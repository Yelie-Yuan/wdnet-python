def cvxpy_control(
        solver="ECOS",
        **kwargs,
):
    """
    Control parameters for CVXPY solvers.

    This function accepts solver settings and additional keyword arguments 
    to generate a dictionary that can be passed directly to CVXPY's `solve` method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    solver : str, optional
        Specifies the solver to use for the optimization problem. 
        Defaults to "ECOS".
        
    **kwargs : dict, optional
        Additional keyword arguments that will be included in the 
        returned dictionary. These can be any solver-specific parameters 
        or options supported by CVXPY's `solve` method.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        A dictionary containing the solver settings and any additional 
        keyword arguments. This dictionary can be unpacked directly into 
        CVXPY's `solve` method.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> solver_params = cvxpy_control(solver="OSQP", verbose=True)
